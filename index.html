          There are places I remember<br>
          All my life though some have changed<br>
          Some forever not for better<br>
          Some have gone and some remain<br>
          All these places have their moments<br>
          With lovers and friends I still can recall<br>
          Some are dead and some are living<br>
          In my life I've loved them all<br>
          <br>
          But of all these friends and lovers<br>
          There is no one compares with you<br>
          And these memories lose their meaning<br>
          When I think of love as something new<br>
          Though I know I'll never lose affection<br>
          For people and things that went before<br>
          I know I'll often stop and think about them<br>
          In my life I love you more<br>
          <br>
          Though I know I'll never lose affection<br>
          For people and things that went before<br>
          I know I'll often stop and think about them<br>
          In my life I love you more<br>
          <br>
          In my life I love you more
